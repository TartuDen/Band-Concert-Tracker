### Objectives

You must follow the same principles as the first subject.

Groupie Tracker Geolocalization consists on mapping the different concerts locations of a certain artist/band given by the Client.

You must use a process of converting addresses (ex: Germany Mainz) into geographic coordinates (ex: 49,59380 8,15052) which you must use to place markers for the concerts locations of a certain artist/band on a map.

You are free to use the Map API you found more appropriate.

### Instructions

The backend must be written in Go
You must handle website errors
The code must respect the good practices
It is recommended to have test files for unit testing.

### Usage
Here is a simple example of the process of giving an address and returning a marker to the location.
This project will help you learn about :

Manipulation and storage of data
HTML
Manipulation of Maps API
Geolocation, geocoding, etc
Event creation and display
JSON files and format
